Noxious is a small survival/maze game about trying to escape a poisonous world, by finding ingredients for a cure before it's too late. 

Game Information:

-Developed in Unity by one programmer.  

-Almost entirely procedural. From the maze generated at the start of the game to the items spawned within it, just about everything in Noxious is algorithmic and will be different with each play-through. 

-Four difficulty modes. Difficulty setting determines how many ingredients are needed for a cure, how many health potions you'll be able to find, and - on insane mode, how much damage the player takes from the poison.
